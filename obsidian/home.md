# Welcome to My Notes

This is the `home.md` file in my Obsidian folder. 

## How this works

- This folder `obsidian/` serves as my vault.
- I can edit this text nicely in **Obsidian**.
- When pushed to GitHub, it builds into a website!

## Links
- [Check out my ideas](ideas.md) (Create this file to test links!)
